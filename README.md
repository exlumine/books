# Books

* Books to acquire
* Books to read
* Books on the shelf


The repository fulfils the following purpose:

1. Summerize my librabry and some kind of wish-list. If you want to buy me a present. ;)
2. Learn to work with `refer` to control the information (formerly I wanted to use `recutils` but it is broken on Arch...).
